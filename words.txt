Compose a small text file, 
in which various 
words are located sequentially, 
separated by spaces and line breaks. 

You can use any English words. 
Develop a program that would search among these words for what the user needs 
and display the total number of repetitions of this word. 
0 - if the word is not present in the file at all.
